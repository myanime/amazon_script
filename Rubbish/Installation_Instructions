Programs:
    gather_merchants:
        Input: files\companies.csv
        Output: files\companies_out.csv
        (companies.csv should be just one column of URLS)
    deduplicate:
        Input: files\companies_out.csv
        Ouput: files\companies_out_deduplicated.csv
    auto_mailer (also know as "iterate_and_spam"):
        Input: files\companies_out_deduplicated.csv
        Before starting auto_mailer, you should deduplicate the list
        manually using the excel_deduplicator
        See the youtube video on how to do this.

        It is pretty easy to do, and does not have to be done so often.
        You would get a list of say 10000 companies, deduplicate it once
        then start the auto mailer. So it does not make sense to automate
        this task.

    when running auto_mailer_live it will output also a file
    \files\spammed.csv
    with a list of the companies that have been contacted.

The next steps are optional, but it is better in alot of ways to
run this program through the python interperter. Its easier to make
changes, track errors and see what is going on.

How to Install The Python Interpreter
--------------------------------------

Install Google Chrome if you dont already have it.

Install Python
--------------
https://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.12/python-2.7.12.amd64.msi

Put the folders on the c:\ drive:
amazon_script
selenium

Install Selenium
-----------------
open the command line in the folder c:\Python27\scripts\
Then type:
    pip2 install selenium

That should be all you need to do, but for good measure install selenium again:
    pip install selenium
Then, also open the command line in the folder c:\selenium and type:
    c:\Python27\python.exe setup.py install
